# UrbandManager
Basic Urband manager for Unity

## Quick start
In the Exports folder, open the UrbandManager.unitypackage file and install it in your Unity project.

Drag the prefab "ConnectToUrbandSharedInstance" (which is in the path UrbandIntegration / Prefabs /) to the unity scene

The prefab "DetectAndSelectDevice" must be included in the scene where you want the list of devices to appear, in order for the user to select his own device
